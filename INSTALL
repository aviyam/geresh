REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirements for installing Geresh, besides a standard C++
compiler, are the following two libraries:

    * FriBiDi

	Available at:
	    <http://fribidi.sourceforge.net>

    * curses (or ncurses)
    
However, you'll probably want to have two additional libraries which Geresh
optionally use:

    * ncursesw
    
	This is curses with wchar_t support, as outlined in the X/Open
	standard.

	THIS LIBRARY IS MANDATORY FOR RUNNING GERESH IN THE UTF-8 LOCALE.
	
	Available at:
	
	    <http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html>
	
	You MUST configure it with "--enable-widec", or else it won't
	generate the appropriate libraries (libncursesw.so, etc).
	
    * iconv
    
	If you want Geresh to recognize a broad range of encodings when it
	loads and saves files, make sure your system has the iconv
	functions.

	Contemporary glibc libraries have the iconv implementation
	built-in, but if you're using an older system, or a non-glibc
	system, you can install libiconv separately:

            <http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/>

IMPORTANT: If you want to run Geresh in the UTF-8 locale, you must install
ncursesw. If you don't compile Geresh against ncursesw then it will print an
error message and abort when it finds out it's running in the UTF-8 locale.

INSTALLING
----------

Like most packages nowadays, Geresh comes with a "configure" script. This
script tries to automatically determine your system capabilities. Type
"configure --help" to learn more. In most cases you'll just do
"./configure", then "make", then "make install" (the latter as root).

When "configure" finishes it prints a short summary of what it has found on
your system. A sample printout:

      " 
	Results:
	--------
	curses library:            ncursesw
	use iconv:                 yes
	default file encoding:     CP1255
	(debugging support:        no)
					"
Please pay attention to what "configure" prints. In particular, note the "w"
in "ncursesw". If "configure" doesn't find ncursesw, it configures Geresh to
use ncurses or plain curses, and prints a warning saying you won't be able
to run Geresh in the UTF-8 locale.

PROBLEMS
--------

Please email me if you encounter any problems installing Geresh.

TESTING
-------

When you start Geresh you may see question marks or gibberish instead of
Hebrew characters. There may be three reasons for that:

1. You're using a ISO-8859-{1,15} or other locale (like "POSIX") in which
   Hebrew characters do not exist (solution: either change the locale or
   use the "--iso88598-term" option); or
2. Your screen font doesn't have Hebrew glyphs; or:
3. The locale (e.g. iso-8859-x) and the terminal (e.g. UTF-8) disagree about
   the encoding. For example, if you see lots of "x"s printed, it probably
   means you're in the UTF-8 locale, but your terminal was not sent the
   'unicode_start' escape sequence.

INSTALLING FRIBIDI AND NCURSESW LOCALLY
---------------------------------------

You don't have to have root permissions to install ncursesw and/or fribidi.
You can install them in your home directory, say "/home/mooffie/local".
Then, to configure Geresh, type:

$ export FRIBIDI_CONFIG=/path/to/fribidi-config
$ ./configure --with-curses=/home/mooffie/local

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
-------------------

Geresh has been compiled and tested under the following UNIX-like operating
systems:

[x86] Linux RedHat 7.3 (Kernel 2.4)
[x86] FreeBSD Release 4.6
[x86] Linux Mandrake 8.3 (Kernel 2.4)
[x86] Cygwin (Windows 98)

(Some linking tests the configure script does failed on Cygwin, but that's
probably a problem with my own system.)
