2004-10-13  VERSION 0.6.3

- The help viewer (accessible via the F1 key) now supports hypertext,
  making it _much_ easier to navigate the User Manual.

- The User Manual was organized a bit. 

- A new command, "Launch external editor", F8, under the "File"
  menu, allows the user to edit the file using his favorite editor.
  The cursor position is passed to the external editor, and when
  using Vim it's also read back. See the manual for details on this
  "magic".

- C-k now cuts to clipboard (a la emacs).

- Quotes in email messages are ignored when spell-checking (only
  when syntax == email).

- Filename completeion with TAB is much faster now (stat(2) used only
  when needed).

- README.themes was update.

- Cantillations (Ta'amei HaMikra) and Arabic vowels were added to the
  "Insert a Unicode character from the list" submenu.

- Minor improvements.

2004-09-23  VERSION 0.6.1

- Themes (see the "Color schemes" submenu under "Dispaly").

- I've applied Baruch's (@tkos.co.il) patch. This solves a C++
  compilation problem on some newer systems.

- The encoding submenu was extended with various Cyrillic and Unicode
  encodings (plus a "Set the default encoding" submenu).

- A new command: C-o (or M-o, in case your Midnight Commander masks
  it) to jump to the place where the last editing operation took
  place. It's a bit like Vim's C-o.

- The 'Search' command is a bit friendlier now (it shares the kbd
  language with the main editing box, and first alpha letter erases
  contents).

- Syntax highlighting: _text_ and *text* now shows on the console too
  (it didn't, because the console couldn't show A_UNDERLINE). It's now
  possible to specify different colors for different levels of quotes
  in mail messages (see 'edit.email-quoteN' in mc.thm).

- Fixed: you can now do ^Z when the speller is loaded.

- Minor improvements.

2004-08-02  VERSION 0.6.0

- Syntax highlighting for HTML and emails

- Highlighting for *text* and _text_

- Visual/logical cursor movement

- Spell-checking with Hspell now works out-of-the-box.
  No need to configure anything.

- A new base-directionality algorithm (contextual-*),
  so Geresh now has a total of five.

- A new sub-menu: "Insert a Unicode character from the list"

- Improved several menus. Direct link to the User Manual from some of them.

- Minor improvements

2004-06-17  VERSION 0.5.0

2003-07-16  VERSION 0.4.1

2003-07-10  VERSION 0.4.0

- Speller support (using the ispell-a protocol)

- Geresh can now be used as a filter to convert logical to visual
  (similar to "bidiv", but better).
