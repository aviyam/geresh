HIGH PRIORITY
=============

- auto-justify is extremely lousy. I must fix that. should support
  numbered/bulleted items, ">" quotes, two spaces after a dot, etc
  etc etc.


LOWER PRIORITY
==============

- Emacs:
    - a kill/clipboard ring [distinct from the clipboard?]
    - shouldn't M-d, M-backspace cut to clipboard as C-k does?
    - key-bindings (C-_, C-w, C-y, M-y, etc.)

- bookmarks? (save/restore cursor position). Thankfully, C-o now
  alleviates the need a bit.

- better Find/Replace.

- add 'bidiv' directionality algo? there's the bigger issue of
  "paragraphs vs lines" and how to define a paragraph.

- ncursesw has an NSM bug at the rightmost column... (but it seems
  I can do nothing about it).

- shared clipboard?

- (console only) big cursor: always, or when alt-kbd is on/off.


I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER DO THESE
================================

- C-^ to switch to previous file a la vim? And maybe a "recent
  files" submenu?

- file browser?

- cygwin/autoconf: check why some of the linking tests don't work on
  my cygwin.

- ^Z (suspend) when speller is loaded: investigate? (ignoring SIGTSTP
  in forked child solved this problem, so I can close this item).

- using pipes (opening "!date") when speller is loaded: investigate?
  (the speller is unloaded when doing pipes, so I can close this item).

- optionally store chars as UCS-2 ?

- speller: fix UTF-8 offsets? (it's not necessary)

- line numbering? --is it useful? for one, it can solve ncursesw's
  NSM bug.

- "follow symbolic links", etc.
